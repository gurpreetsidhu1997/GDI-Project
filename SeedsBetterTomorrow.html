          Self-sufficiency of villages is ingrained in the discourse of India’s
          freedom movement as a Gandhian ‘ideal’. But farm economies, not just
          in India, fall far behind on social and economic indexes. There’s
          something eternally unfixed, which brings us here. Markets are still
          not fair and innovations are harder to access. What we take to rural
          India is new technology, better integration of departments and
          markets.

            There are multiple steps that India and the developing world can
            take, towards building stronger, sustainable and progressive
            agrarian economies. In regions like Orissa, Jammu, Kenya and Sri
            Lanka, we work on multiple verticals and offer a comprehensive
            enhancement of existing systems through the following measures:

            PRICE INFORMATION DISSEMINATION
          </h2>

          <p>
            We strive to build a price information system for farm and fisheries
            produce to disseminate market prices of select commodities to
            farmers. Awareness about price mechanisms is quite critical to their
            growth and their choices

            HORTICULTURE MARKETING

          <p>
            This will enable supply chain members such as breeders, producers,
            consumers and market intermediaries to build marketing systems.

          <p>
            Agtech will enable data collection and make decision-making easier
            by making information on price, soil conditions and markets
            accessible on a single dashboard.

            Determining intellectual property rights over variety of seeds,
            registering of new seeds in adhering to the processes around
            introducing a new seed into the domestic market, thereby enabling

            HARVEST COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE

          <p>
            To give farmers a macro picture of the potential of alternate crops,
            harvest crops and alternate methods that can enhance profitability.
            This can incentivise cultivation of medicinal, aromatic crops,
            fruits, millets etc.

            ‘Why are farmers poor?' was a question I asked again and again
            during my growing up years, especially during my time at SRCC, Delhi
            University. Because of GDi, I got an opportunity to work on agrarian
            reforms in Odisha. One key challenge was in executing the ag-tech
            challenge (inviting startups to present their solutions to select
            problem statements given by the dept) since the entire challenge
            involved multiple partners for implementation, knowledge sharing,
            funding etc. Trying to design the event by accommodating the vision
            of all such stakeholders without losing sight of the end goal was a
            very challenging aspect’
