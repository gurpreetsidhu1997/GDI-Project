          Science will offer an alternate to oil one day but water will forever
          survival. Today, if governments understand the real power of data,
          advanced databases can be created to quickly map and address all kinds
          of public problems. Data helps extend the reach of government schemes,
          insights can be generated from data and building transparent data
          systems eliminates frauds and leakages. The thirst for data will only
          increase with time.

            Data creates a single version of the truth that is indisputable. The
            benefit of having all parts of a multi-layered government machinery
            synced to one data-set can lead to better resource allocation,
            better policy planning and programme management, leading to better
            outcomes for citizens. Faulty decisions based on outdated
            information can be avoided and accurate status of ongoing activity
            is made available. Along with the GSWS Department of Government of
            Andhra Pradesh, Data.org and NRLM, GDi is putting in place better
            cutting-edge data practises in India.

          <p>
            Hygiene checks and anomalies identification are regularly undertaken
            to judge the sanity of the available data and suggest corrective
            actions. A central dashboard was developed to continuously monitor
            the performance and reach of various DBT schemes implemented by the
            department.

            Credit leaks are eliminated if transparency of data becomes a
            precedent. Through a scheme-wise analysis, inclusion and exclusion
            errors during scheme delivery are prevented.

            Through surveys and consistent interactions with social sector

          <p>
            Frequent, effective, and low-cost data snapshots provide the basis
            for immediate action during the life of the project rather than
            waiting for a midterm or final evaluation. We envision for AgDev a
            system of consistent, standardized data, which enables regular
            monitoring not only for individual projects but also for larger
            missions. Enough data enables comparative analysis and maps hits and
            misses well. By using common, universal metrics – whether it is
            climate adaptation, gender inclusion, or income generation –data
            cuts across categories and geographies and points to interesting
            differences, similarities, strengths, and opportunities to improve.

            Chance to identify and eliminate inclusion and exclusion errors in
            scheme delivery has been the most satisfying work in the project. A
            simple code error could have made over 5,000 beneficiaries, who were
            otherwise eligible, ineligible for a particular financial assistance
            scheme. We were able to identify the error in time and prevent this
            exclusion error from creeping in’
