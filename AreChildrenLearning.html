          Classrooms, uniforms and textbooks mean nothing if the child doesn’t
          internalise what is being taught. Education is learning, nothing more,
          nothing less. Through Ed-tech interventions and PAL (Personalised
          Adaptive Learning), we talk about ‘learning outcomes’. Tearing through
          a maze of rote learning, teacher absenteeism and poor infrastructure,
          this method connects straight to the mind of the child.

            GDi has one vision, to achieve higher learning outcomes through
            interventions like ed-tech, better parent-teacher engagement,
            mapping of grades to assess and enhance learning patterns along with
            outcome-based innovative finance projects that boost at home
            learning in aspirational districts. GDi works with the state
            (Rajasthan, Punjab, aspirational districts of NITI Aayog) to achieve
            NextGen education reforms through interventions like Vision setting,
            Nextgen Infrastructure, In-class pedagogy, Strengthened teachers &
            Community involvement.

            ENHANCED PARENT ENGAGEMENT
          </h2>

          <p>
            A state-wide mega PTM was held in Punjab and end-to-end planning and
            execution of the event was managed by GDi. The event went on become
            the largest PTM conducted in the country with nearly 21 lakh parents
            attending. Feedback collected from these events serves as a database
            to initiate and execute new schemes.

            A MISSION FOR BETTER GRADES:
          </h2>
          <p>
            In Punjab, GDi designed and facilitated weekly review meetings
            between district officials and the education minister to discuss
            progress. A dashboard mapped student performance in exams and weekly
            practice bots were introduced for students to practise for exams;
            the Management Information System (MIS) platform was leveraged and
            officials at the district level were engaged to track progress.

            GOING BEYOND CLASSROOMS:
          </h2>
          <p>
            We believe in the power of Personal Adaptive Learning (PAL) that
            caters learning to the child’s individual needs and fosters
            engagement instead of forced rote learning. Through Chatbots that
            can be accessed on any device, learning can happen at home, in the
            field, anywhere the child is. Through a multi-modal learning module
            - a mix of TV, radio and YouTube along with daily offline worksheets
            and weekly assessments through a chatbot on a Smartphone and even
            board games to increase learning outcomes, the education experience
            is enhanced.

            CHATBOTS, THE FUTURE OF LEARNING:
          </h2>
          <p>
            Digitising of learning in remote areas can reduce drop-out rates in
            schools for girls between grades 8-12 and increase their retention
            in classrooms because they actually learn. In Rajasthan, we have
            increased girls' learning outcomes through different digital access
            points across 33 districts.

            THE INDIAN ASPIRATIONAL STORY:

          <p>
            On the lines of Systemic Impact Bonds, NITI Aayog wishes to procure
            EdTech services where payment for service delivery is linked to
            achievement of pre-defined gains in learning levels of participating
            students as well as usage of tab-labs. As part of this engagement,
            we will support in the implementation and governance of the
            initiatives in the identified aspirational districts.

            We had proposed to add an agenda item where parents were to sign a
            pledge saying they will send their child to school every day. One of
            the parents said she didn’t know how to and instead put a thumb
            imprint. The teacher told the student that it was her responsibility
            to ensure that in next such event, her mother should be able to sign
            her own name so she could convert this thumb imprint into a
            signature. This gave me goosebumps. This was the first time the
            mother had visited the school and met the student’s teacher and to
            have sparked that little investment in her towards her child’s
            education is a great win. In addition to impacting lives, I think my
            personal growth here is also something that I am happy about. We
            conducted the meeting with two weeks’ notice and were able to engage
            about 97% schools across rural and urban Punjab. Usually the state
            complains about not being able to receive data from schools but the
            systems we set up (simple google forms, automated trackers) enabled
            the state to follow up with schools easily.
