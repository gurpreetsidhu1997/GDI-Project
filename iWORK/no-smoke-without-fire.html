          If the air is smoky, there must also be fires that led to it needs
          quelling. Today, the air requires logic, science, smart solutions and
          swift implementation. It needs action, not words. Through real-time
          data mapping, hotspot management and an inter-sectoral strategy to
          combat paddy straw burning, we strive to leave no stone unturned to
          make air breathable and give people a better life.

            In 2018, a WHO report revealed that 14 of the 20 most polluted
            cities in the world are Indian. Every single year, India’s Diwali
            festivities are accompanied by news articles carrying pictures of
            women standing knee-deep in a frothy Yamuna or that of paddy straw
            fires across miles & miles along India’s agrarian north. At GDi, we
            develop dashboards, use data and tech to map the problem and
            parallelly, strengthen local governance to execute sustainable
            alternatives. GDi is working with Governments of Delhi, Punjab and
            Haryana to mitigate air pollution in North India.

            REAL- TIME SOURCE APPORTIONMENT
          </h2>

          <p>
            We have set-up a Project Management Unit at the Department of
            Environment, Govt of NCT of Delhi. As part of our work, we
            facilitate the coming together of thought leaders like IITs, NGOs
            and several government agencies under one single, comprehensive
            plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            One such initiative is the ‘real-time source apportionment’ through
            which major sources of particulate matter, be it secondary inorganic
            aerosols that travel long distances or in-house pollution, biomass
            burning (wood etc), vehicular emissions and dust (road and
            construction) can be mapped real-time. Hourly data on the sources of
            pollution and the direction from which external pollution may have
            reached Delhi are now being tracked, making response mechanisms
            swifter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through ISRO satellite mapping and real time source apportionment,
            identifying sources of pollution like stubble burning, biomass and
            waste burning, vehicular and industrial emissions and road dust etc,
            GDi is able to present accurate data to multiple levels of
            governments.

            We are supporting the re-development of Delhi Pollution Control
            Committee’s (DPCC’s) Green Delhi App, an app for citizens to report
            violation of environmental norms. The app has 27 civic agencies of

            the concerned agency and get resolved in a time-bound manner.

            Making the crop residue machines available to farmers, develop a
            rental market for such machines. Happy Seeders and Super Seeders do
            in-situ planting of the next crop. Presently, machines are expensive
            and may be lying idle the rest of the year. The farmer needs to be
            educated that these machines will enrich organic content in the farm
            and ensure cost savings, bringing down the need for fertilisers and
            insecticides amounting to Rs 1,500 to 2,000 per acre.

          <h2 class="second-section__content-heading">EX-SITU MANAGEMENT:</h2>
          <p>
            Increasing consumption of stubble in thermal and biomass plants is
            much needed. All forces on ground, private and public, must align to
            ease the transfer of stubble to industry. We coordinate with
            multiple government departments on ground to connect the dots
            between state-run and private power plants, the state’s electricity
            department and ensuring logistics and operations of stubble delivery
            to the power plants from farmers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with the government machinery, we help promote solutions that
            exist to use straw and other agricultural waste as fuel for
            industry. This includes briquettes, bio-char, pellets, bio-gas,
            bio-diesel and other such products that can be utilised across the
            industry spectrum. The supply chain is streamlined and alternate
            usage is explored and awards are offered to officers and farmers who
            are adopting sustainable methods. District level execution and
            monitoring ensures we are quelling fires when they begin, for there
            is never any smoke without fire!

            Our knowledge about air pollution is limited. Even in 2023, most of
            us have some sort of idea that ‘vehicular pollution is the main
            contributing factor’ or so on and so forth. To that extent the real
            time source apportionment study is a great step forward in terms of
            ground the air pollution conversation in evidence. I have realised
            that air pollution is one of those topics that requires coordination
            between governments to an extraordinary degree. Personally, the only
            way out seems to be hard enforcement (such as China) of pollutions
            norms. When government agencies are deprived of funds, functions,
            and functionaries, they often look for out of the box actions, which
            is basically a euphemism for everything except the one job they are
            supposed to do – enforce rules.
